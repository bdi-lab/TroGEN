                "definition": "A technique in jailbreak prompting where generative AI is guided to bypass its default restrictions by crafting prompts that include detailed expert identities. This approach frames requests as if seeking the expert's opinions or assertions, enabling the model to generate information that would otherwise be restricted. Leveraging In-Context Learning, it automatically creates expert identities tailored to specific instructions, facilitating more precise and unrestricted responses. For example, unlike role-playing, this approach involves mentioning a specific expert, presenting Expert A's claim or opinion using expressions like ‘claims’, ‘argues’, or ‘pointed out’, and then following it with a related dangerous question.",
